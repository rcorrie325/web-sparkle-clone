git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).

## Testing Pipeline & Quality Assurance

This project includes a comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure code quality and reliability:

### 🔧 **Development Workflow**

1. **Make Changes**: Edit code locally or via Lovable
2. **Pre-commit Validation**: Automatic checks run before each commit
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions validate all changes
4. **Code Review**: Optional automated review for quality feedback
5. **Merge Protection**: Only validated code reaches main branch

### 🛡️ **Pre-commit Hooks**

Automatically run before each commit to catch issues early:

- **ESLint**: Code style and error checking
- **TypeScript**: Type safety validation  
- **Build Check**: Ensures deployable artifacts
- **Code Quality**: Removes trailing whitespace, fixes formatting

**Setup Pre-commit Hooks:**
```sh
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
pip install pre-commit

# Install git hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually on all files (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 🚀 **GitHub Actions CI/CD**

**Automated Testing on Every Push/PR:**
- **Multi-Node Testing**: Node.js 18.x and 20.x compatibility
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection with Trivy
- **Build Verification**: Ensures successful production builds
- **Artifact Generation**: Build outputs stored for debugging

**Test Commands:**
```sh
npm run test        # Complete test suite (lint + type-check + build)
npm run lint        # ESLint validation
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run type-check  # TypeScript compilation check
npm run build       # Production build
```

### 📊 **Quality Standards**

**All changes must pass:**
- ✅ ESLint validation (max 10 warnings)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation 
- ✅ Successful build generation
- ✅ Security scan (HIGH/CRITICAL issues only)

**Build Requirements:**
- Generate valid `dist/` directory
- Include `index.html` in build output
- No TypeScript errors
- ESLint warnings below threshold

### 🔍 **Security & Monitoring**

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated with Trivy
- **Dependency Checks**: Security issues in packages detected
- **Build Artifact Verification**: Ensures deployable code
- **Error Tracking**: Failed builds prevent merges

### 📚 **Additional Resources**

- **Detailed Testing Guide**: See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)
- **Troubleshooting**: Build failures, hook setup, and fixes
- **Workflow Configuration**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Hook Configuration**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
